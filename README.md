# JavaScript-code-along with Stephen Garcia
I code alonged this youtube video endorsed by freecodecamp and gained some essential skills in fundamentals of JScript. Highly Recommend!

## What I learnt:
1. JavaScript variables: fundamental building blocks for storing and structuring data.

2. Symbols and Operators: essential in performing calculations, modifying data and executing large cooparations.

3. Control flow: directing programs using loops and conditional statements, making your code dynamic and interactive.

4. objects: for creating objects with OOP. This section covers jScript objects and how they develop your application.

5. Arrays: Explores commonly used methods to manipulate and itilize arrays effectively.

6. Functions: Covers expression functions vs function declarations. It enables to write clean reusable code that can simplify complex tasks 

## Todo:
1.  Check out objects in objects
2. Curry functions
3. Infinite curry functions
4. classes and OOP in general
